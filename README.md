# UKTides

A plugin for the OpenCPN navigation program.

Uses the UKHO Tidal API to show times/heights of HW/LW at over 600 UK tidal stations

At present only a Windows version is available. 

If you want to compile your own version you will need to obtain an API key from the UKHO.

No data is saved by the plugin, at the request of the UKHO.
